Observations:

1.	One observation from the Latitude vs Max Temperature graph in the dataset is that locations closer to the equator generally have higher temperatures, with a plateauing effect at around 20 degrees north and south of the equator. In our current dataset, the northern latitudes tend to have a higher max temperature than the southern latitudes, reflective of the fact that it is currently still summer in the northern hemisphere. There is also a greater range of max temperatures at around 20 degrees, whereas a greater percentage of cities closer to the equator maintain a higher temperature. Some areas in the 20 degrees latitude range are hotter than the equator depending on the presence of humidity or lack thereof.

2.	 In general, the closer to the equator the city is, the higher the levels of humidity. Since it is summertime in the northern at the present the north has more humidity on average than southern hemisphere cities at the tropics. The dry season in the tropics is caused by trade winds as it rains and dry air travels from the equator southward, or vice versa in the north during its winter. Cities that are closer to the poles also tend to have higher levels of humidity, especially in the summer, as is seen by our northern latitude cities at the present. 

3.	There does not seem to be a strong correlation between either wind speed and latitude or between cloudiness and latitude, for winds this is because they are affected by land and water mass variations and are not uniform across the earth. Cloudiness is also affected by different pressures and humidity and is not uniform.
